# Using Marketing analytics to identify high-impact campaign strategies for New Customer growth at BCG📈

## Introduction

Recent campaign performance analysis highlights a clear pattern in how first-time customers engage with marketing communications.The conversion behavior here is driven less by surface variables (channel presence alone) and more by **tone**, **engagement depth**, and **perceived personalization**.

This case study evaluates Campaign A and Campaign B across channels (Email, Instagram, Web Banner), focusing on **new vs. existing customer behavior**, conversion rates, time spent, and revenue outcomes. The goal: identify which message tone and channel combination best supports new customer acquisition—while understanding the tradeoff with total revenue.
