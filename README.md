# Using Marketing analytics to identify high-impact campaign strategies for New Customer growth at BCG📈

## Introduction

Recent campaign performance analysis highlights a clear pattern in how first-time customers engage with marketing communications.The conversion behavior here is driven less by surface variables (channel presence alone) and more by **tone**, **engagement depth**, and **perceived personalization**.

This case study evaluates Campaign A and Campaign B across channels (Email, Instagram, Web Banner), focusing on **new vs. existing customer behavior**, conversion rates, time spent, and revenue outcomes. The goal: identify which message tone and channel combination best supports new customer acquisition—while understanding the tradeoff with total revenue.



## Message Tone Analysis

**Which Tone Resonates with First-Time Customers?**

*Campaign A (Informal, Conversational Tone)* emerges as the strongest performer for new customers.

**Key Findings**
- **Total new customer sales (Campaign A): $3,726.99**
- **Highest engagement time: 3,654.04 seconds** (Email – Campaign A)
- Users who spent more time reading Campaign A emails were significantly more likely to convert.
- Informal language increased perceived authenticity, making the message feel **personal and trust-building**.

📌 **Insight**: First-time buyers respond better to human, conversational messaging than polished or formal sales language.



## Channel Effectiveness

**Which Channels Reach New Audiences Best?**
*Ranked by Total Engagement Time (Converted + Non-Converted)*:

- **Email**
- **Instagram**
- **Web Banner**
   - **Total time spent across channels: 9,875.44 seconds**.
   - Email consistently drove deeper engagement and higher intent actions.
   - Instagram supported discovery and reinforcement.
   - Web banners underperformed across all customer types.

📌 **Insight**: Direct, opt-in channels outperform passive exposure formats for acquisition.



## Conversion Behavior: New vs. Existing Customers

| Metric                  | New Customers    | Existing Customers |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Highest Conversion Rate | **0.63 (Email)** | 0.51 (Overall)     |
| Avg. Time on Site       | **106.71 sec**   | Lower              |
| Best Channel            | Email            | Email              |
| Weakest Channel         | Web Banner       | Web Banner         |

**Notable Pattern**

-While existing customers show strong baseline conversion (0.51)
-New customers viewing Email content convert at an even higher rate (0.63).

📌 **Insight**: Email is not just a retention channel. It is a **high-intent acquisition driver** when tone and content align.



## Revenue Performance by Channel (New Customers)

Campaign A Results
- **Email**: $2,124.47
- **Instagram**: $969.46
- **Web Banner**: $633.06

Across all channels, **Campaign A consistently outperformed Campaign B** in driving new customer purchases, despite Campaign B generating higher total revenue overall.



## Underperforming Areas

- **Web Banners** recorded:
  - Lowest conversion rates for both campaigns
  - Lowest sales overall
- **Lowest recorded sale**:
  - Web Banner + Campaign A (Existing Customers): **$121.23**
